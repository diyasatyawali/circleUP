# CircleUp – Connect. Chat. Grow.

## 👋 Introduction

Hi, I’m Diya Satyawali and I’m excited to introduce *CircleUp, a social networking web app designed to help people connect based on shared **goals, **interests, and **location* — all while maintaining *initial anonymity*.

CircleUp isn't a dating app. It's a platform for building *meaningful, interest-based friendships*, especially for:
- Students or professionals new to a city
- People facing social anxiety or introversion
- Anyone looking for genuine, purpose-driven connections

---

## 🔁 How It Works

CircleUp uses a *swipe-left / swipe-right* interface to discover potential connections.

Each profile card displays:
- A *virtual avatar* (not a real photo)
- The user’s *main purpose* for joining (e.g., “looking for a gym buddy”)
- Their *interests* and *hobbies*
- A short *personal summary*

---


## 🔍 On-Demand Filtering

Users can filter connections in real-time based on:
- *Location*
- *Field/Domain* (e.g., tech, design, etc.)
- *College or Company*
- *Gender* (optional)

---

## 👥 Group Creation Feature

Users can *create or join groups* based on:
- Common interests
- College, company, or residential society
- Public or private settings

Examples:
- A yoga group in your apartment complex
- A college-specific project group

---

## 🔐 Anonymous Chat 

After a mutual match:
- Users chat anonymously

Only when *both* choose to reveal, their real profiles are shown.

---

## 👨‍🎓 Target Audience

CircleUp is designed for:
- *Students* and *young professionals*
- People *new to a city*
- *Introverts* or anyone needing emotional/social support
- Those seeking *roommates, **fitness partners, or **activity groups*

---

## 💻 Tech Stack

Built using the *MERN stack*:
- *MongoDB* – Database
- *Express.js* – Backend framework
- *React.js* – Frontend library
- *Node.js* – Runtime environment

Key Features:
- Real-time anonymous chat
- Group creation and management
- Smart recommendations
- Dynamic filters
- Timed identity reveal

---

## 🚧 Challenges Faced

Some of the toughest parts of development:
- Designing the *anonymous chat system* with timed identity reveal
- Implementing a *smart, flexible recommendation algorithm*
- Ensuring *group privacy* and proper user controls

---

## 🚀 Future Plans

Planned enhancements:
- *Map-based* suggestions and live location visibility
- *Event scheduling* within groups
- *Mood-based* matching
- Strong *reporting and safety features*
